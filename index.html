My Flexibility, adaptability approach to work and shift patterns has always be one of the sources of my strength. Iâ€™m happy to travel for both shift and training purposes.  I understand and recognise the importance of working together as a team and i have been always working as an active member of my team. Nevertheless, am also happy to work as an individual if need required.
